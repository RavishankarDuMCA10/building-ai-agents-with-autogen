      "- The mean and median prices are quite close, indicating a relatively symmetric distribution of the closing prices over the month.\n",

      "- The highest and lowest prices demonstrate a price range of around $26.97, indicating notable price movement.\n",
      "- From the line chart visualization, you can observe the concept of trend or consistent directional movement (increasing or decreasing) in price. The inclusion of a moving average can provide insights into short-term trends against daily fluctuations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusions:\n",
      "Based on the analysis:\n",
      "- Apple (AAPL) stock showed moderate volatility with a substantial price increase approaching a high nearing the end period.\n",
