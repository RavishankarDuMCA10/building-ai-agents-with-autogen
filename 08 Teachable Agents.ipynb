      "Sure, here's a simple recipe for making Gulab Jamun:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Jamuns:\n",
      "- 1 cup milk powder\n",
      "- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)\n",
      "- A little milk (as needed to knead the dough)\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Sugar Syrup:\n",
      "- 1.5 cups sugar\n",
      "- 1.5 cups water\n",
      "- 3-4 cardamom pods, crushed\n",
      "- A few saffron strands (optional)\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon rose water (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Prepare the Sugar Syrup:**\n",
      "   - In a pan, combine the sugar and water and bring it to a boil.\n",
      "   - Add the crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands to the syrup.\n",
      "   - Let it simmer for about 10 minutes on low heat until it slightly thickens.\n",
      "   - Add rose water if using, and turn off the heat. Set it aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Make the Dough:**\n",
      "   - In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.\n",
      "   - Add ghee and mix well with your fingers until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.\n",
      "   - Gradually add milk, a small amount at a time, and knead gently to form a smooth, soft dough. Be careful not to over-knead.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Shape into Balls:**\n",
      "   - Divide the dough into small portions and roll them between your palms to make smooth, crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks as these can cause the balls to break while frying.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fry the Jamuns:**\n",
      "   - Heat ghee or oil in a pan on medium-low heat. The oil should be enough to cover the jamuns completely while frying.\n",
      "   - When the oil is moderately hot, gently slide the balls into the oil.\n",
      "   - Fry them on a low flame by stirring gently until they become golden brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Soak in Sugar Syrup:**\n",
      "   - Once all the jamuns are fried, drain the excess oil and add them into the warm sugar syrup.\n",
      "   - Let them soak in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours. They will gradually absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure both the jamuns and sugar syrup are slightly warm when combining them. Enjoy your delicious homemade Gulab Jamun!\n",
