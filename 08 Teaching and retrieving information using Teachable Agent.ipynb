Let's analyze the current equation:\\n\\n\\\\[ 7 \\\\times 5 + 8 \\\\times 3 = 59 \\\\]\\n\\nFirst, calculate the current left side total:\\n\\\\[ 7 \\\\times 5 = 35 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 8 \\\\times 3 = 24 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 35 + 24 = 59 \\\\]\\n\\nNow, to change the outcome to 80, we need the left-hand side to equal 80. Seeing as we have:\\n\\\\[ 59 + x = 80  \\\\]\\nWe find: \\n\\\\[ x = 21 \\\\]\\n\\nThis means we need to increase the outcome by 21.

Identify which integer modification would lead directly to a total change of +21.\\n\\nOptions:\\n- Increasing 7, 5, 8, or 3 in the multiplication terms.\\n- Calculate the necessary increase in one term to yield an additional 21 upon evaluation.\\n\\nLet's examine modifications:\\n\\n1. If we change 7 to something else in \\\\( 7 \\\\times 5 = 35 \\\\), we require:\\n   \\\\[(7 + \\\\Delta) \\\\times 5 = 56, \\\\quad \\\\text{since } 35 + 21 = 56\\\\]\\n   Solving for \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\), we have \\\\( 5 \\\\Delta = 21 \\\\), therefore \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) would not be an integer here (it's 4.2).\\n\\n2.
